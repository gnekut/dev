UDACITY: Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program
Project Submissions


----- TERM 1 -----
Project 1: Lane Line Detection - Make use of Canny Edge Detection, image masking, and Hough Transforms to detect lane lines.

Project 2: Traffic sign classifier using Deep Neural Networks w/ convolution, pooling, dropouts with image alterations (greyscale, normalization, center mean, etc.)

Project 3: Behavioral Cloning - Autonomous driving car built from a convolutional neural network framework, trained on sample data taken from the Windows Driving Simulator.

Project 4: Advanced Lane Line Detection - Use directional gradient and color channel thresholds and perspective transforms to predict lane lines with polynomial fits.

Project 5: Vehicle Detection and Tracking - Trained a linear support vector machine with different feature extraction methods (spatial binning, color channel histograms, and histogram of orientation gradients (HOG)) to identify cars and track them through a video stream.


----- TERM 2 -----
Project 6: Extended Kalman Filters - Implement an (Radar:Extended | Lidar:) Kalman Filter to predict the state of a vehicle using sensor fusion of RADAR and LIDAR data feeds. Sensor covariance and noise estimates were provided.
