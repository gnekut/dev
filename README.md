# UDACITY: Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program
## Project Submissions


### TERM 1
_Project 1: Lane Line Detection_ - Make use of Canny Edge Detection, image masking, and Hough Transforms to detect lane lines.

_Project 2: Traffic sign classifier_ - Deep Neural Networks w/ convolution, pooling, dropouts with image alterations (greyscale, normalization, center mean, etc.)

_Project 3: Behavioral Cloning_ - Autonomous driving car built from a convolutional neural network framework, trained on sample data taken from the Windows Driving Simulator.

_Project 4: Advanced Lane Line Detection_ - Use directional gradient and color channel thresholds and perspective transforms to predict lane lines with polynomial fits.

_Project 5: Vehicle Detection and Tracking_ - Trained a linear support vector machine with different feature extraction methods (spatial binning, color channel histograms, and histogram of orientation gradients (HOG)) to identify cars and track them through a video stream.


### TERM 2
_Project 6: Extended Kalman Filters_ - Implement an (Radar: Extended | Lidar: ) Kalman Filter to predict the state of a vehicle using sensor fusion of RADAR and LIDAR data feeds. Sensor covariance and noise estimates were provided.
